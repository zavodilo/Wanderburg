name: editor
description: The kit's web editor (_utils/editor) — location view with free/game cameras, toon toggle, Global Settings tab (constants inspector from schema.js, saves to Constants.js), Objects tab (location objects in Objects.js — FBX/GLB import into assets/models, properties, gizmo, part spin or animation clip), UI tab (game interface layout in UILayout.js — skill ui), EN/RU interface language (i18n.js), live editing via loader.js, server.mjs API. Read before editing files in _utils/, before adding a constant to the inspector and before adding interface text.

# Editor (`_utils/editor`)

```
editor.bat                     # in the kit root: port 8090 (or the next free one), opens the browser
editor.bat 9100 --no-open
```

URL: `http://localhost:8090/_utils/editor/`. Needs only Node. The editor is not part of the
game: it does not go into the build (`BUILD_EXCLUDE`), and the game knows nothing about it.

## Structure

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `server.mjs` | static files from the project ROOT (no-store) + `GET /api/status`, `POST /api/save-constants`, `/api/save-objects`, `/api/save-ui`, `/api/pick-model`, `/api/import-model`. `EDITOR_API_VERSION` |
| `save.mjs` | writing without HTTP: `patchScalar`, `saveConstants(root, changes)`, `formatObjects`, `saveObjects(root, objects)`, `formatUI`, `saveUI(root, elements)` (skill `ui`), backups, `ERRORS`/`failure`, `isModelPath`; covered by `tests/editor-save.test.mjs` and `tests/ui.test.mjs` |
| `index.html` | header with the language switch `#lang-switch`, view toolbar, canvas `#view-canvas`, right pane with tabs `#pane-tabs` (`.pane-panel[data-tab]`: settings, objects, ui); script order: `i18n.js`, `schema.js`, `loader.js`, kit modules (`/libs/playcanvas.min.js`, `/js/Objects.js`, `/js/UILayout.js`, `/js/World3D.js` … `/js/Model3D.js`, `/js/Gltf3D.js`, `/js/Location3D.js`, `/js/UI.js`; no `Game.js` — the editor does not run the game), `inspector.js`, `objects-panel.js`, `ui-panel.js`, `lab.js`, `main.js` |
| `i18n.js` | `I18N`: language (EN by default, choice in `localStorage` `arcengine.editor.lang`), dictionaries `STRINGS.en/ru`, `t(key, params)`, `pick({ en, ru })`, markup via `data-i18n*`, `lang-changed` event |
| `loader.js` | fetches `/js/Constants.js`, replaces `^const` with `var`, runs it through indirect `eval` — constants become writable `window` properties |
| `schema.js` | `KIT_SCHEMA` — inspector groups and fields, texts `{ en, ru }`; the client's `EDITOR_API_VERSION` |
| `history.js` | `EditHistory`: undo/redo (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Shift+Z, Ctrl+Y) — entries `{ key, undo, redo }`, the same `key` within 800 ms is merged, `batch(fn)` — one step; in text and number fields Ctrl+Z is the browser's own |
| `inspector.js` | Global Settings tab: fields from the schema, groups collapsed at startup, dirty highlight, ↺, search in both languages, "Save to Constants.js" (Ctrl+S); `Toast` |
| `objects-panel.js` | `ObjectsPanel` — Objects tab: list of `location.objects`, properties of the selected one, move gizmo, click selection, FBX import, "Save to Objects.js", revert; `PaneTabs` — tabs (`TABS`, `current`, choice in `localStorage` `arcengine.editor.tab`, the window `pane-tab` event on a switch) |
| `ui-panel.js` | `UIPanel` — UI tab: the game interface (`UILayout.js`) drawn by the game's `UI.js` over the view, drag and resize, properties, "Save to UILayout.js" — skill `ui` |
| `lab.js` | location view: `Location3D` (objects — a copy of `LOCATION_OBJECTS`) + the game's `CameraController`, camera modes, toon toggle, reaction to edits; frame `tick`: `location.update(dt)` -> `camera.update(dt)` -> `renderFrame()` |
| `debug-tools.js` | `DebugTools` — the view toolbar's debug corner: the "view:" select (`Debug3D.setMode`: back faces in red, normals, wireframe) and "Lint scene" (`Debug3D.lint`) with a results panel `#lint-panel` over the view. Binds itself on `DOMContentLoaded` — `lab.js` and `main.js` do not know about it; finding texts come from `Debug3D` and stay English |
| `main.js` | `I18N.init()` -> `EditorLoader.load()` -> `EditHistory.init()` -> `PaneTabs.init()` -> `Inspector.init()` -> wrapper around `Inspector.apply` (`constants-changed` event + history entry; `revertAll` — as one step) -> `Lab.init()` (inside — `ObjectsPanel.init(lab)`, `UIPanel.init(canvas)`) |

Editing a field: `Inspector.apply` writes `window[NAME]` -> `constants-changed` event ->
`Lab.onConstant(name)` by prefix:

| Prefix / name | What happens |
|---|---|
| `WORLD3D_*` | `World3D.applyRenderConstants(view)` — light, shadows, materials, toon, ink edges live |
| `CAMERA_*` | `camera.applyConstants()`; in game mode orientation/start zoom — `home()` right away |
| `UI_*` | `UIPanel.refresh()` — the interface scale |
| `MODEL_*`, `GAME_*` | nothing to apply: read when a clip starts / by the game |
| `LOCATION_GROUND` | `location.loadGround()` |
| `GROUND_TILE_SIZE` | `terrain.applyTileSize()` |
| `TERRAIN_*`, `LOCATION_*` | terrain rebuild at most once per frame, location objects settle on the new ground (`buildTerrain`) |

`WORLD3D_SHADOW_MAP` and `WORLD3D_SHADOW_RADIUS` are read when the view is created — they take effect after F5.

## Saving

`POST /api/save-constants` with `{ changes: [{ name, value }] }`. The server patches ONLY
lines `const NAME = <number>;` (it refuses to touch a formula), a hex literal stays hex,
before writing — a backup in `_utils/.backups/` (last 20). Name — `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.
Rejection — `{ name, ok: false, code, error }`: the client translates `code` (`not_found`,
`not_literal`, `bad_value`, `bad_name`) with the key `err.<code>`, `error` is English text for the log.

`POST /api/save-objects` with `{ objects: [...] }` — `Objects.js` is written WHOLE (header
`OBJECTS_HEADER` + one line per object), backup `Objects-*.js` in the same place. Record:
`{ name, model, kind, x, y, h, rot: [x, y, z], scale: [x, y, z], anim?, clip? }` (old scalar `rot`/`scale`
are expanded into triples; `anim: { part, axis, speed, dir }` and `clip: '…'` are written at the end of the line, if present).
Checks: `model` — `assets/….fbx` or `….glb` in Latin characters without spaces and `..` (`bad_model`),
numbers finite, scale > 0, `anim.axis` from `x -x y -y z -z`, `anim.speed` ≥ 0 (`bad_value`);
object name, `anim.part` and `clip` without quotes and control characters (`cleanName`); precision:
position, angles and speed 0.1, scale 0.001. An old server process silently drops new fields and rejects `.glb` with the old "must be ….fbx" text — restart `editor.bat` (the client warns when `api` < `EDITOR_API_VERSION`, now 19).

## Objects tab

- Records — `location.objects` (`{ def, mesh, error, loaded }`, `Location3D.addObject`):
  the panel edits `def` fields and calls `location.placeObject(rec)`. Changing `kind` rebuilds
  the object (material group, ink edges and outline are assigned on add).
- "Animation" section of a `.glb` model (`Model3D.clips(rec.mesh)` exists): one row "Clip" — a
  `<select>` of `clips.names()`, "— none —" deletes `def.clip` (`setClip`); `Location3D.playClip`
  picks the change up on the next frame.
- "Animation" section of an FBX model (`renderAnim`, `setAnim`): part — a `<select>` of `metadata.part` of the
  model's meshes (model not loaded yet — only the saved part is listed), "— none —" deletes
  `def.anim`. Picking a part sets the axis via `guessAxis`: the thinnest side of the part along
  its axes, the end pointing away from the model center (for the mill's blades — `-y`, front
  view); default speed 10 rpm. `placeObject` is not needed — `Location3D.update` reads
  `def.anim` every frame (`lab.js` calls it in `tick`, the spin is visible in the editor).
  Edits are merged by `field:<index>:anim`.
- "Dirty" layout — `JSON` of the records ≠ `ObjectsPanel.saved`; "Revert" rebuilds all objects from `saved`.
- "Import model…" -> `POST /api/pick-model` `{ title }`: the server opens a system dialog in
  `assets/models/` (Windows: PowerShell `-STA` + WinForms `OpenFileDialog`, path and title
  via env, TopMost owner window). A file inside `assets/` is used in place, one from outside is
  copied into `assets/models/` (Latin name; the same file is not duplicated, a different one
  gets the suffix `-2`). Validation — `.fbx` with a binary FBX header or `.glb` with the `glTF` magic (`not_model`,
  `not_binary`, `not_glb`); a text `.gltf` with external files is not imported. Cancel — `code: 'cancelled'`. Not Windows — `code: 'unsupported'`, the client
  picks a file with `<input type=file>` and sends the bytes to `POST /api/import-model?name=<file>`.
  A new object appears at the frame center on the ground (`camera.groundFocus()`).
- Gizmo — the engine's `TranslateGizmo`/`RotateGizmo`/`ScaleGizmo` on a shared gizmo layer
  (`pc.Gizmo.createLayer`), modes on the toolbar `#gizmo-modes` and
  keys 1/2/3: move (axes + ground-plane square), rotate (X/Y/Z rings, world axes), scale
  (per axis, center — uniform), world axes (`GIZMOSPACE_WORLD`). Drag steps come from the
  gizmo events (`TransformGizmo.EVENT_TRANSFORMSTART/MOVE/END`). The camera
  ignores a press on the gizmo — `camera.ignorePointer = (e) => gizmoHit(e)`: a Picker probe
  of the gizmo layer plus
  a direct pick of the utility layer (hover does not update without mouse movement). Moving
  along X/Z keeps `h` (the object follows the terrain), along Y — changes `h`. Gizmo rotation
  writes the mesh `rotation` (or `rotationQuaternion` if set) — angles are taken into `rot`,
  `placeObject` resets the quaternion after release.
- History: a step is layout snapshots before/after (`snapshot`/`restore`); the same set of
  models and kinds is edited in place, otherwise objects are rebuilt. Gizmo — one step per
  drag, field — merged by `field:<index>:<field>`.
- LMB click without movement (≤ 4 px) on an object mesh — select (`scene.pick` filtered by the
  root's `metadata.locationObject`) and switch to the Objects tab; on empty space — deselect.
- Keys (focus not in a field): Del/Backspace — delete, F — frame it, Ctrl+D — duplicate,
  Esc — deselect, Ctrl+S — save (both Constants.js and Objects.js, whichever changed).

## Interface language

- Static markup text — English by default, with attributes `data-i18n` (text),
  `data-i18n-title`, `data-i18n-placeholder`; keys — in `I18N.STRINGS`.
- Text from code — `I18N.t('key', { name: value })`, substitution `{name}`.
- New string = a key in BOTH dictionaries `en` and `ru`; no translation — English is shown.
- Language switch: `applyDom()`, then the `lang-changed` event — the inspector rebuilds
  (expanded groups and search are kept), `lab.js` redraws the hint and the chip.
- Code, comments, the server log and `Constants.js` are not localized — English only.

## New constant in the inspector

1. Literal in `Constants.js` (color — `0xRRGGBB`, mode — an integer).
2. Read in code via `typeof NAME !== 'undefined' ? NAME : default`.
3. Field in `KIT_SCHEMA`: slider `{ name, label: { en, ru }, min, max, step, hint: { en, ru } }`,
   `kind: 'color'` or `kind: 'select'` with `options: [{ value, label: { en, ru } }]`.
   A mode — select only; levels 0/1/2 and no/yes — the ready-made `SCHEMA_LEVELS`, `SCHEMA_NO_YES`.
4. New prefix — add a branch in `Lab.onConstant`.

## Pitfalls

- Edited `server.mjs` or `save.mjs` — restart `editor.bat`: Node reads them once. When
  endpoints change, bump `EDITOR_API_VERSION` in `server.mjs` AND `schema.js` — the client
  warns about an old server.
- Asset paths in the editor are from the root (`assetBase: '/'`): the page lives in
  `/_utils/editor/`, a relative `assets/…` would resolve there.
- Camera keys do not work while focus is in an inspector field — `lab.js` drops focus on a
  press on the view.
- The frame is rendered every tick (the engine draws on demand): a "render on flag"
  gate leaves the previous picture stale.
- Without the app input systems (the engine application) the gizmo is drawn but cannot be
  dragged; without
  `camera.ignorePointer` LMB on an arrow also orbits the free camera.
- A comment with a quoted `'assets/…'` is a false reference for the builder's asset scanner
  (it reads comments too): the build fails on a "missing asset". The `Objects.js` header
  writes the path without quotes.
- `Objects.js` on the editor page is a lexical `const`: the panel works with a copy, after
  saving the global is stale, the baseline is `ObjectsPanel.saved`.

## Checklist

0. Interface of the GAME (not of the editor) — skill `ui`.
1. `node tools/check.mjs` passes (editor types — `_utils/editor/tsconfig.json`, skill `build`).
   Editor console without errors, the server dot is green.
2. A new constant shows in the inspector in both languages (EN/RU), the edit applies to the
   scene, "Save to Constants.js" writes exactly one line of `Constants.js`.
3. New interface text switches with the language.
4. Objects: selection by click and in the list, the gizmo drags, "Save to Objects.js" writes a
   file that passes `node --check`, and the scanner (`collectRefs`) sees no missing assets.
5. The game (`run.bat`) starts with the saved values and objects.
