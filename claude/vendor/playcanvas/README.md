Portable skills that help AI coding agents build and verify polished applications with
[`playcanvas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/playcanvas),
[`@playcanvas/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playcanvas/react), and
[`@playcanvas/web-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@playcanvas/web-components).

## Install

Add the skills to your project with the [Agent Skills](https://skills.sh/) installer:

```bash
npx skills add playcanvas/skills
```

Use `--all` to install every skill into all detected agents or `-g` for a user-level installation.
Start a new conversation after installing or updating so the agent discovers the new skill metadata.

Choose one installation route for each agent. Installing both Agent Skills and a native plugin for
the same agent exposes duplicate skills.

### Native plugins

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code and Claude Code desktop</strong></summary>

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add playcanvas/skills
claude plugin install engine@playcanvas
```

In the desktop app's Code tab, installed plugins are available under **+ → Plugins**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex CLI and app</strong></summary>

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add playcanvas/skills
codex plugin add engine@playcanvas
```

The Codex app uses the same marketplace and plugin installation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

For a single CLI session, load the plugin directly from a checkout:

```bash
cursor-agent --plugin-dir .
```

For a persistent installation, add this repository as a plugin marketplace in Cursor or link the
repository root into `~/.cursor/plugins/local/engine`. Teams and Enterprise organizations can
publish the same marketplace to their organization.

## Why PlayCanvas Skills

- Resolve the active PlayCanvas authoring surface from the project instead of guessing from installed
  dependencies.
- Check installed package declarations, exports, examples, and production scripts before using an
  API.
- Inspect GLB geometry, transforms, clips, joints, morphs, and hierarchy before choosing placement or
  animation values.
- Keep scene ownership, model calibration, physics, effects, UI, and game state predictable.
- Reuse Engine features such as `CameraControls`, `Water`, `ProceduralSky`, and `CameraFrame` with
  their required integrations intact.
- Finish with runtime and screenshot evidence instead of treating a successful build as visual proof.

## Usage

Ask your coding agent for the outcome you want. The matching skills supply the PlayCanvas-specific
workflow and verification steps. For example:

```text
Build a Direct Engine product viewer for these GLBs. Inspect and calibrate every model, reuse the
shipped camera controls, and verify grounding and framing in the browser.
```

```text
Polish this @playcanvas/react prototype with deterministic game states, a state-driven HUD, pooled
effects, coherent lighting, and screenshot checks.
```

## Supported surfaces

The skills resolve the active surface from imports and markup, then read only its matching reference:

| Surface | Packages | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Engine | `playcanvas` | bootstrap, assets, scripts, rendering, animation, physics, lifecycle |
| React | `playcanvas`, `@playcanvas/react` | React ownership, hooks, components, assets, Engine interop |
| Web Components | `playcanvas`, `@playcanvas/web-components` | declarative elements, lifecycle, assets, Engine interop |

Skills prefer the packages installed in the target project. CI compiles representative usage against
pinned supported package versions, and Renovate proposes dependency updates.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |

| [`find-examples`](skills/find-examples/SKILL.md) | Find and adapt official examples matching the installed package version. |
| [`reuse-scripts`](skills/reuse-scripts/SKILL.md) | Discover and integrate production scripts shipped with the Engine. |
| [`inspect-glb`](skills/inspect-glb/SKILL.md) | Measure default-pose GLB bounds, transforms, clips, joints, morphs, and hierarchy offline. |
| [`calibrate-model`](skills/calibrate-model/SKILL.md) | Record stable scale, grounding, pivot compensation, and yaw for repeated models. |
| [`configure-animation`](skills/configure-animation/SKILL.md) | Configure clip playback, blending, state graphs, and retargeting from inspected data. |
| [`assemble-scene`](skills/assemble-scene/SKILL.md) | Compose semantic, visual, collider, physics, and effect hierarchies. |
| [`light-scene`](skills/light-scene/SKILL.md) | Build coherent lighting, exposure, shadows, reflections, water, and grading. |
| [`add-effects`](skills/add-effects/SKILL.md) | Add placed, pooled, and lifecycle-safe transient effects and trails. |
| [`build-hud`](skills/build-hud/SKILL.md) | Build accessible, state-driven overlays, menus, gauges, timers, and indicators. |
| [`manage-game-state`](skills/manage-game-state/SKILL.md) | Structure deterministic state, pointer lock, pause, reset, clocks, and cooldowns. |
| [`verify-pixels`](skills/verify-pixels/SKILL.md) | Prove a rendering change is pixel-identical or bounded before shipping. |
| [`reduce-draw-calls`](skills/reduce-draw-calls/SKILL.md) | Measure and cut draw calls with element lifecycle, batching, and instancing. |
| [`override-shader-chunks`](skills/override-shader-chunks/SKILL.md) | Customize StandardMaterial shading with version-pinned shader chunk overrides. |
| [`bake-lighting`](skills/bake-lighting/SKILL.md) | Precompute static lighting with the engine Lightmapper or an offline bake. |

Every integration loads the same canonical files from [`skills/`](skills/). Host manifests contain
distribution metadata only.

PlayCanvas Skills targets Engine application workflows. It does not automate the PlayCanvas Editor,
create or publish Editor projects, manage cloud services, or replace project-specific art direction
and gameplay design.
